Subject: ENGR00217318-1 flexcan: exit stop mode when resume

Currently flexcan only exits stop mode by remote wakeup,
if system resumes normally, the flexcan may still in stop mode
and can not work anymore.

Change to also exit stop mode during normal resume in case system
is not remote wakeup by flexcan.
