Subject: ENGR00180350-1 HDMI set infoframe information
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Get speaker allocation data block information from the EDID.

Translate the EDID speaker allocation to audio infoframe
speaker allocation (different bit mapping) given the number
of channels of audio being played.

Set channel count information in HDMI_FC_AUDICONF0.
Set speaker allocation information in HDMI_FC_AUDICONF2.

From CEA-861-D spec:
NOTEâ€”HDMI requires the CT, SS and SF fields to be set to 0 (Refer
to Stream Header) as these items are carried in the audio stream.
