006-bridgefib.patch
    This patche [appears] to provide a ioctl to query the location of a certain MAC address to determine the interface from the bridge FIB.

007-bridge-mac-ageing-fix.patch
    This patch is necessary because when Untangle is "bridging" traffic it doesn't actually allow traffic through the bridge, it intercepts it.
    This causes traffic not to flow via the normal methods so the "forwarding information base" (or FIB) of the bridge doesn't get updated.
    As such, without this patch the bridge can lose information about where a IP/mac pair lives and won't know where to send the traffic and just drop it.
    Pinging the host will instantly resolve that state as the FIB would be updated. This patch updates the FIB when a packet is received on a bridge port.

009-extensions.patch
    This provides extensions to cmsg so that special fields like TTL, TOS, NFMARK, and SADDR can be specified in cmsg ancilarry data options in recvfrom and sendmsg.
    This is used in libnetcap to send and receive UDP packets.

010-icmp_frag.patch
    This patch ensures that ICMP fragmentation needed packets correctly reach their non-locally bound socket so that ICMP MTU discovery works with sessions end-pointed on untangle.

011-nonlocal_binding.patch
    This patch implements non-local binding which is essential for creating "spoofed" TCP connections from the original client IP.

013-iptable_tune.patch
    This adds the "tune" table in netfilter which comes at the very end which is used for various tasks in our networking setup.

020-imq-debian.patch
    This adds IMQ (intermediate queue device) which allows for ingress QoS filtering on WAN interfaces
