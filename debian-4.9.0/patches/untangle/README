bridge-mac-ageing-fix.patch
    This patch is necessary because when Untangle is "bridging" traffic it doesn't actually allow traffic through the bridge, it intercepts it.
    This causes traffic not to flow via the normal methods so the "forwarding information base" (or FIB) of the bridge doesn't get updated.
    As such, without this patch the bridge can lose information about where a IP/mac pair lives and won't know where to send the traffic and just drop it.
    Pinging the host will instantly resolve that state as the FIB would be updated. This patch updates the FIB when a packet is received on a bridge port.

extensions.patch
    This provides extensions to cmsg so that special fields like NFMARK, and SADDR can be specified in cmsg ancilarry data options in recvfrom and sendmsg.
    This is used in libnetcap to send and receive UDP packets.

ipsec-policy-bypass.patch
    This patch bypass the xfrm check on tcp receive path for reinjected packets from UVM. reference http://bugzilla.untangle.com/show_bug.cgi?id=8948 for more detail

iptables_tune.patch
    This adds the "tune" table in netfilter which comes at the very end which is used for various tasks in our networking setup. Added support for Kernel 3.16

iptables_socket.patch
    This changes the "-m socket" iptables match to modify the packet with the socket's mark if a socket is found.
    This is a total hack as an iptable match shouldn't modify the packet, but the issue is that there is no conntrack entry for packets returning to nonlocal sockets
    So we have no way to restore the QoS/bandwidth control mark so TCP ingress QoS doesn't work without this hack.

physdev.patch
    The patch is trying to find the bridge port in bridge fdb inside xt_physdev module, so the physoutdev field can match in the FORWARD chain.
    The kernel without patch can't find the bridge port as the patcket hasn't reach the Bridge code internal yet. 
    Back to Linux kernel 2.6.18, the kernel is trying to make packet go through bridge forwarding desicion first and then go through forwarding chain. 
    Follwoing two patchs are original changes in kernel tree at timeframe about 2.6.18 that removed the physoutdev matching in the FORWARD chain.

imq-Apply-4.9-patch.patch
    This patch allows ingress shaping and shaping over multiple interfaces.  Patch retreived from:
    https://github.com/imq/linuximq/blob/master/kernel/v4.x/linux-4.9-imq.diff

iptables-mac.patch
    Changes to iptables mac matcher to allow creating iptables rules that match individual bytes of the source MAC address. This is
    needed so the uvm can pass both the source and destination interface marks in the source mac address for packets reinjected on the utun
    device. This allows us to create two rules per interface that restore both marks instead of the NxN number of rules that would be required
    without the ability to isolate specific bytes of the MAC address.
