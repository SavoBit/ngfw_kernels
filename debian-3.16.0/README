to make sure you have everything necessary
make deps

to build packages:
make src pkgs

to develop:
'make src' to expand the src
edit the source in untangle-debian-3.2.0/linux-3.2.51/debian/build/source_untangle/ (on amd64 anyway)
'make kern' to build kernel package
dpkg -i kernel package and reboot


to port patches: 
generally I'll do a 'make src'
the go into linux-2.6-2.6.32/debian/build/
cp -r source_amd64_untangle source_amd64_untangle.modified
then patch in source_amd64_untangle.modified and get everything cleaned up
create a new diff -urN based on those two directories and drop the new patch in patches/
repeat.

to get building working:
sometimes the 'make kern' fails and often it hides the error message
go into linux-2.6-2.6.32/debian/build/build_amd64_untangle_amd64/
and run 'make' and it will display the error messages that caused the fail if it failed during the kernel build
