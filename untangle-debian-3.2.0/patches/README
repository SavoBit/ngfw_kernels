006-bridgefib.patch
    This patche [appears] to provide a ioctl to query the location of a certain MAC address to determine the interface from the bridge FIB.
    XXX - This is no longer needed with 022-physdev. We are keeping it until it is verified that 022-physdev fulfills our needs and works as expected.

009-extensions.patch
    This provides extensions to cmsg so that special fields like TTL, TOS, NFMARK, and SADDR can be specified in cmsg ancilarry data options in recvfrom and sendmsg.
    This is used in libnetcap to send and receive UDP packets.

013-iptables_tune.patch
    This adds the "tune" table in netfilter which comes at the very end which is used for various tasks in our networking setup.

014-nfqueue-untangle-mode.patch
    Adds support for appending conntrack information to queued packets. This allows you to avoid a conntrack lookup for queued packets.
    NOTE: Usage of this patch could be removed in favor of classd's handling of conntrack table.
    The classd daemon subscribes to all conntrack table changes and manages its own list in memory and pairs queued packets with the in memory table.

015-iptables_socket.patch
    This changes the "-m socket" iptables match to modify the packet with the socket's mark if a socket is found.
    This is a total hack as an iptable match shouldn't modify the packet, but the issue is that there is no conntrack entry for packets returning to nonlocal sockets
    So we have no way to restore the QoS/bandwidth control mark so TCP ingress QoS doesn't work without this hack.
     
020-imq.patch
    This adds IMQ (intermediate queue device) which allows for ingress QoS filtering on WAN interfaces. Patch from http://www.linuximq.net

022-physdev.patch
    The patch is trying to find the bridge port in bridge fdb inside xt_physdev module, so the physoutdev field can match in the FORWARD chain.
    The kernel without patch can't find the bridge port as the patcket hasn't reach the Bridge code internal yet. 
    Back to Linux kernel 2.6.18, the kernel is trying to make packet go through bridge forwarding desicion first and then go through forwarding chain. 
    Follwoing two patchs are original changes in kernel tree at timeframe about 2.6.18 that removed the physoutdev matching in the FORWARD chain.
